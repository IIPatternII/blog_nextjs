So, I heard that you want to develop a Dapp.

If that's the case, you came to the right place. Here, I'll explain everything you need to know to start your journey as a Cardano Dapp/Web3 developer. I'll also provide a link to my free course, but read this before jumping in!

Ok, are you ready? Let's go! üî•

## What is a Dapp?

<p>
	A Dapp (Decentralized app) is a <b>software application that runs on a </b>

				<h4>Decentralized network</h4>
				<p>
					A decentralized network is a collection of interconnected
					but independent elements ‚Äî known as nodes ‚Äî that interact
					with one another without the need for a centralized power or
					server.
				</p>
				<p>
					The network is decentralized specifically because the nodes
					can communicate and work together without the need for a
					central authority.
				</p>
			</div>
		}
	>
		<b>decentralized network</b>
	</SideNote> (click on the highlight for a pleasant surprise. All the highlights
	have it! üòÉ). A Dapp is just like any other software application. It could be
	a website or an app on your phone or computer. What makes a Dapp different than
	a traditional app is that it's built on a decentralized network, like Cardano
	or Ethereum.
</p>

Running an app in a decentralized network gives you extra possibilities regarding what your app can do. A Dapp can:

-   Mint/burn NFTs
-   Charge, pay, and redistribute money.
-   Issue certificates.
-   Act as an escrow.
-   Provide loans.
-   Manage recurrent payments.
-   Provide a platform for trustless governance.
-   Manage identities.
-   And many other things.

And the best of all is that your Dapp will run in a system that is trustless, permissionless, and independent. (And if you use Cardano, it's cheap for your users, too üòú.)

It's not without sacrifices, though. A Dapp is a product of combining many software engineering disciplines. To write a Dapp, you have to:

-   Securely process and manage your user's data.
-   Securely interact with the blockchain.
-   And provide a beautiful and easy-to-use interface to make your users so happy that they'll never stop talking about your Dapp.

## The components that constitute a Dapp.

<blockquote>
	<p>
		Yeah yeah yeah... a Dapp is just an app that runs on a decentralized
		network... cool. The thing is, I also don't know how regular apps work.
	</p>
	‚Äî Said someone, probably.
</blockquote>

I got you! Let's have a brief overview of the components that constitute a Dapp.

To create a Dapp, you need three things (two are a must):

-   A front-end.
-   A way to interact with the blockchain.
-   A back-end (optional, but usually needed).

### The frontend

The frontend is **the component of the Dapp that a user interacts with**. The visual component. It can be a website, a mobile app, or a desktop app.

						If you want to develop a desktop app, you also have to

						macOS, and Linux) has its own quirks.

						You could get by using a <b>framework</b> that allows
						you to build <b>cross-platform</b> apps using Web
						technologies (like I do üòõ). Electron, per example. So
						no need to learn much of the specific desktop stuff.
						<p>

						To develop a web app, you have to take into account that

							for all modern browsers, so no biggie
						</b>{' '}
						üòâ.)
					</p>
					<p>
						To build a website's frontend, you need at least three
						technologies: <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and{' '}
						<b>CSS</b>. But, if you want to build a more complex web
						app, the usual is to use a framework like <b>React</b>{' '}
						that makes the development easier.
					</p>
				</div>

	]}
/>

And now is when you go:

<blockquote>
	<p>"That's so much! I'll take ages to learn all that!"</p> ‚Äî Every coder
	when starting their coding journey.
</blockquote>

If it seems like a lot, it's because it is a lot. But **you don't need to learn all that at once**.
You can pick one technology (\*cough\* web \*cough\*) and build your Dapp
with that. And if (more like "when," cause this is addictive) you get interested
in another tech, you'll learn it much faster after knowing how to code other stuff!
**SO...MUCH...FASTER! üèéüí®**

Once your frontend is working, you have a beautiful Dapp that doesn't do anything. Let's add some functionality by interacting with the blockchain!

### The interaction with the blockchain

Blockchains are just a bunch of _nodes_ (servers/computers) that interact following a specific set of rules. If you want to talk to the blockchain, all you have to do is interact with one of its nodes, and the node will propagate your interaction with the rest of the nodes. That's it!

There are two main ways to interact with a node:

-   **Spin up your own node:** If you have your own node, your Dapp can talk with it directly! Anyone can do it (although I don't recommend it unless you know what you are doing).
-   **Use a third-party API:** some companies will maintain Cardano nodes for you and provide an
    <SideNote
    	content={
    		<div>
    			<h4>Application Programming Interface (API)</h4>
    			<p>
    				<b>
    					Software used to communicate between computers or
    					programs.
    				</b>
    				User interfaces are created to allow people to interact with
    				programs, and APIs are created so other software can interact
    				with the software that provides the API
    			</p>
    		</div>
    	}
    >
    	API
    </SideNote>
    so you can talk to them! (Way easier ‚Äî and cheaper ‚Äî than spinning up your own
    node!) Usually, you pay only for the request you made. So if no one uses your
    Dapp, you pay nothing, and if everyone uses it, you pay proportionally.

The Cardano blockchain runs something called "**smart contracts**" (I'll leave the details for the course). Smart contracts are **automated digital agreements**. They are self-executing, incorruptible, unalterable, and don't require any actions or the presence of third parties.

When you communicate with the Cardano blockchain, you can interact with smart contracts already present there. Now, if you only interact with smart contracts already present in the blockchain, you can only do so much. In most cases, you'll need to write your own smart contracts and deploy them in the blockchain. That's when **Plutus** comes in.

**Plutus is the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain**. It allows you to write applications that interact with the Cardano blockchain. To write Plutus contracts, you have to know:

-   **Haskell**: Haskell is the programming language for Plutus contracts. It's a functional programming language that very few can use. (Haskell for complete beginners is covered in the free course üòâ.)
-   **Blockchain protocols**: You have to know how the Cardano blockchain itself works under the hood (node communication, the eUTxO model, etc.).
-   How to use all the **Cardano ecosystem and Plutus tools**.

Done! That's enough to build a Dapp! Write a smart contract, deploy it, and create the frontend to interact with it. _But, wait! There's more! For an extra $99, you get the exclusive..._ **just kidding!** üòÜ There really is more, though ü§£.

If you have to interact with the blockchain for everything your app does, some apps will be too expensive to use! An NFT project can get by with just a frontend and a smart contract to mint the NFTs. But, if you ‚Äî for example ‚Äî want to create a social media platform that logs everything into the blockchain, your users will have to pay transaction fees for everything they do! Publishing a post? Transaction! üí∏ Commenting? Transaction! üí∏ Hitting the like button? Transaction! üí∏

No one will use that! **That's one of the main reasons ‚Äî but not the only one ‚Äî you'll still need a backend**.
