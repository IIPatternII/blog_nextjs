So, I heard that you want to develop a Dapp.

If that's the case, you came to the right place. Here, I'll explain everything you need to know to start your journey as a Cardano Dapp/Web3 developer. I'll also provide a link to my free course, but read this before jumping in!

Ok, are you ready? Let's go! ðŸ”¥

## What is a Dapp?

<p>
	A Dapp (Decentralized app) is a <b>software application that runs on a </b>
	<SideNote

			<div>
				<h4>Decentralized network</h4>
				<p>
					A decentralized network is a collection of interconnected
					but independent elements â€” known as nodes â€” that interact
					with one another without the need for a centralized power or
					server.
				</p>
				<p>
					The network is decentralized specifically because the nodes
					can communicate and work together without the need for a
					central authority.
				</p>
			</div>
		}
	>
		<b>decentralized network</b>
	</SideNote> (click on the highlight for a pleasant surprise. All the highlights
	have it! ðŸ˜ƒ). A Dapp is just like any other software application. It could be
	a website or an app on your phone or computer. What makes a Dapp different than
	a traditional app is that it's built on a decentralized network, like Cardano
	or Ethereum.
</p>

Running an app in a decentralized network gives you extra possibilities regarding what your app can do. A Dapp can:

-   Mint/burn NFTs
-   Charge, pay, and redistribute money.
-   Issue certificates.
-   Act as an escrow.
-   Provide loans.
-   Manage recurrent payments.
-   Provide a platform for trustless governance.
-   Manage identities.
-   And many other things.

And the best of all is that your Dapp will run in a system that is trustless, permissionless, and independent. (And if you use Cardano, it's cheap for your users, too ðŸ˜œ.)

It's not without sacrifices, though. A Dapp is a product of combining many software engineering disciplines. To write a Dapp, you have to:

-   Securely process and manage your user's data.
-   Securely interact with the blockchain.
-   And provide a beautiful and easy-to-use interface to make your users so happy that they'll never stop talking about your Dapp.

## The components that constitute a Dapp.

<blockquote>
	<p>
		Yeah yeah yeah... a Dapp is just an app that runs on a decentralized
		network... cool. The thing is, I also don't know how regular apps work.
	</p>
	â€” Said someone, probably.
</blockquote>

I got you! Let's have a brief overview of the components that constitute a Dapp.

To create a Dapp, you need three things (two are a must):

-   A front-end.
-   A way to interact with the blockchain.
-   A back-end (optional, but usually needed).

### The frontend

The frontend is **the component of the Dapp that a user interacts with**. The visual component. It can be a website, a mobile app, or a desktop app.

				<div>
					<p>
						If you want to develop a mobile app, you have to take
						into account that each platform (mainly Android and iOS)
						has its own programming languages, set of technologies,
						and tools.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Android uses Java and Kotlin as{' '}
							<SideNote content={<div></div>}>
								programming languages
							</SideNote>{' '}
							and AndroidStudio as its main{' '}
							<SideNote content={<div></div>}>
								development environment
							</SideNote>{' '}
							.
						</li>
						<li>
							iOS uses Objective-C and Swift as programming
							languages and XCode as the main development
							environment.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Personally, I develop my mobile apps in Flutter (
						<SideNote content={<div>aaa</div>}>
							cross-platform framework
						</SideNote>
						) using Dart programming language and VSCode/Vim as my development
						environments. And I use the platform-specific technologies
						previously mentioned to write minor platform-specific code.
						I highly recommend the Flutter framework.
