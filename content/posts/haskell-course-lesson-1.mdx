Some courses start by explaining all the properties of Haskell. Others by dedicating entire lessons/chapters to the theory behind the language, Category theory (a branch of mathematics), lambda calculus (more maths), etc. We won't do that here. Those approaches have nothing wrong, but they are designed to teach people with previous knowledge of mathematics and computer science ‚Äî which most don't have.

This course is geared to people that do not code. The lecture will be written as if the person already knows basic computing skills but nothing about programming. And further explanations will be provided by clicking on highlights like <SideNote color='yellow' content={<div>This is a short explanation of the concept highlighted ü§ì</div>}>this one</SideNote>.

Ok. Are you ready? Let's go!

## GHCi (Glasgow Haskell Compiler Interactive)

A <SideNote color='violet' content={<div><h4 className='font'>Compiler</h4><p>A compiler is a program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.</p></div>}>compiler</SideNote> is a <SideNote color='red' content={<div>paragraph</div>}>program</SideNote> that translates code written in one <SideNote content={<div><h4>Programming language</h4><p>A programming language is a formal language used by programmers (developers) to communicate instructions to computers. Usually, programming languages are written in plain text where each word, symbol, and number, has a pre-defined meaning for that specific language.</p><p>Example:</p><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/C_Hello_World_Program.png' alt='screenshot of C programming language'/></div>}>programming language</SideNote> into another language. In our case, the compiler will translate Haskell into something our computer can understand. We need _compilers_ and _interpreters_ because computers don't understand our language and don't want to write code in the computer's language like in the old days (trust me).

The cool thing is that it doesn't matter if you have Windows, macOS, Linux, or whatever. Write Haskell, and the GHC will manage the rest. Cool right?

GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) is a compiler and interactive environment for Haskell. We can compile programs and use them. Or we can evaluate Haskell expressions on the fly using the interactive environment provided by the GHC (the GHCi).

For now, we'll use the GHCi. This interactive environment allows us to write code, hit enter, and get the result instantly! ‚ö°Ô∏èüòÑ
