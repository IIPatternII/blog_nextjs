Some courses start by explaining all the properties of Haskell. Others by dedicating entire lessons/chapters to the theory behind the language, Category theory (a branch of mathematics), lambda calculus (more maths), etc. We won't do that here. Those approaches have nothing wrong, but they are designed to teach people with previous knowledge of mathematics and computer science ‚Äî which most don't have.

This course is geared to people that do not code. The lecture will be written as if the person already knows basic computing skills but nothing about programming. And further explanations will be provided by hovering or clicking in highlights like *this one*.

Ok. Are you ready? Let's go!


## GHCi (Glasgow Haskell Compiler Interactive)

A *compiler* is a *program* that translates code written in one *programming language* into another language. In our case, the compiler will translate Haskell into something our computer can understand. We need *compilers* and *interpreters* because computers don't understand our language and don't want to write code in the computer's language like in the old days (trust me). 

The cool thing is that it doesn't matter if you have Windows, macOS, Linux, or whatever. Write Haskell, and the GHC will manage the rest. Cool right?

GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) is a compiler and interactive environment for Haskell. We can compile programs and use them. Or we can evaluate Haskell expressions on the fly using the interactive environment provided by the GHC (the GHCi).

For now, we'll use the GHCi. This interactive environment allows us to write code, hit enter, and get the result instantly! ‚ö°Ô∏èüòÑ
