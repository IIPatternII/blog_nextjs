Today, we'll learn about pattern matching. This Haskell feature is, by far, one of my favorites. You'll see why in a sec. But before that, here's the solution to the last lesson's homework:

**Lesson 9 homework's answer:**

```haskell
verifyBlock ::
  (String, [(String, String, Int, String)], String) ->
  String ->
  [(String, String, Int, String)] ->
  String
verifyBlock block prevBlockHash listTx =
  if block == createBlock prevBlockHash listTx
    then "The block checks out"
    else "Error! Fake block!"
```
